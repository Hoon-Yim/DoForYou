## Project Description
This web service called ***DoForYou*** serves as a platform that facilitates connections between individuals seeking assistance and those willing to offer help.<br/><br/>

Users can create threads specifying their needs, situations, and the type of assistance required. For example, someone might seek help in designing a website logo. They can outline the task scope and offer compensation details. Other users, interested in helping, can submit requests with information about their skills and experience. The user seeking help can then review these requests and choose the most suitable helper. This streamlined process fosters a community where individuals can efficiently connect and collaborate on various tasks.<br/><br/>
